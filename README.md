## A word count activity of seven of Louisa May Alcott's novels using Python

I recently went to see the movie Little Women (2019) which seemed to have perfectly reproduced the classical novel Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. I personally found every bit of the movie beautiful. I especially enjoyed the characters' dialogues, and I later learned some of the actual sentences from the novel had been borrowed in filming this movie.

That is how I came up with the idea of looking at a few of popular writing works of Louisa and find out the words she liked to use in her writings the most. The text files of books were collected on website Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org), and I only included the main content of the books which excludes prefaces, advertisements, etc. Expect to see some interesting facts!
