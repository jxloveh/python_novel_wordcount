You can find the output of the python codes posted separately. If you skim through those 7 lists down below, I believe you
will immediately think the same as me: "Wait, these are not all same lists.

Despite being very common prepositions and articles, AND, THE, TO, A, OF are consistently the top 5 frequently used words in
6 out of our 7 novels. The one exceptional novel, <Behind a Mask; Or a Woman's Power> still has those five in its top 6 along
with the word I which appears in all of our seven lists. Although we do not know about the viewpoint of each novels, she likes
to tell the narrator's stories by saying "I" a plenty of times. Again, I is found in all of the 7 novels; IN, in 6 of them;
HER, in 5; WAS, in 4; FOR, in 3; SHE and AS, in 2; and HE, HIS, MY, THAT, YOU, and WITH, in 1.

In the next python file, I am going to investigate if this is from Louisa's writing habit or also found in other authors' works
using 6 novels by Jane Austen and 1 by Emily Bronte.

One interesting aspect I notice here, though, is HER appears 5 out of 7, SHE appears twice. On the other hand, HE and HIS appear
only once, in <Behind a Mask; Or a Woman's Power> and <Jo's Boys>, respectively. Louisa used Feminine pronouns way more busily
than masculine ones, which may indicate her special interest in describing the female characters in her works.
