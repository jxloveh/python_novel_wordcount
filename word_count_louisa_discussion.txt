You can find the output of the python codes posted separately. If you skim through those 7 lists down below, I believe you
will immediately think the same as me: "Wait, these are not all same lists.

Despite being very common prepositions and articles, AND, THE, TO, A, OF are consistently the top 5 frequently used words in
6 out of our 7 novels. The one exceptional novel, <Behind a Mask; Or a Woman's Power> still has those five in its top 6 along
with the word I which appears in all of our seven lists. Although we do not know about the viewpoint of each novels, she likes
to tell the narrator's stories by saying "I" a plenty of times. Again, I is found in all of the 7 novels; IN, in 6 of them;
HER, in 5; WAS, in 4; FOR, in 3; SHE and AS, in 2; and HE, HIS, MY, THAT, YOU, and WITH, in 1.

One interesting aspect I notice here, though, is HER appears 5 out of 7, SHE appears twice. On the other hand, HE and HIS appear
only once, in <Behind a Mask; Or a Woman's Power> and <Jo's Boys>, respectively. Louisa used Feminine pronouns way more busily
than masculine ones, which may indicate her special interest in describing the female characters in her works.

Based on the top word lists from 6 novels by Jane Austen and 1 by Emily Bronte, now I can tell that those words were not
from Louisa's personal preference but most frequently used words in English language in general.

As a beginner to Python, now I see why there is a strategy of excluding "stopwords" using methods like nltk package. I might
start another task now only regarding words after removing stop words including the words that I just found most frequently
used such as AND, THE, TO, A, and OF. Then there may be more interesting findings.

However, personally, I found encountering those "stopwords" repeatedly on top of the lists I made pretty fun. We just never
notice we use those words so often in our writings and conversations!
